# idris-mode for emacs

This is an emacs mode for editing [Idris][] code.

Syntax highlighting functional languages is a little quirky; I've
deferred to haskell-mode for some things
(e.g. `font-lock-variable-name-face` for operators) and done some
other things as appropriate for Idris. `font-lock-type-face` isn't
used at all, for example, and data types declared with `data` use the
same face as functions and values defined with `=`.

## Inferior Idris

There is now support for running an Idris interpreter in a buffer. Use
'C-c C-l' to load the current Idris buffer into the interpreter. This will
spawn an inferior idris process and load the buffer. It will report warnings
if idris reports any. Pressing C-c C-l again will reload that buffer - if you
switch to a different buffer and press C-c C-l, that buffer will be loaded
instead.

Customize `inferior-idris-path` if idris is not on your default path.

## Installation

Drop `idris.el` somewhere in your load path and `(require 'idris)`
somewhere in `~/.emacs` or `~.emacs.d/init.el`.
