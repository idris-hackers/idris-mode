;;; Commentary:

;; This is a collection of simple tests for idris-mode.
;; Structuring:
;; Packages modules (files) have their own corresponding test files.
;; idris-commands.el -> idris-commands-test.el
;; idris-navigate.el -> idris-navigate-test.el
;; ..
;; Tests for modules that are too small or not yet covered enough by tests
;; can be left as part of the idris-tests.el
;;
;; Naming tests:
;; `ert-deftest idris-X-Y`
;; where X stands for function or state to be tested
;; and Y for additional context or behaviour.
;; Example:
;; `ert-deftest idris-quit`
;; `ert-deftest idris-quit-logging-enabled`

;;; Code:

;; Implementations
(require 'idris-mode)

;; Testing
;; load-file-name is present in batch mode and buffer-file-name in interactive
(let ((test-dir (file-name-directory (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name)))))
  (add-to-list 'load-path test-dir)
  ;; In batch mode default dir points to ../ and causing issues with saving
  ;; Idris fixtures so we set it to the test-dir to avoid the issues.
