;;; Commentary:

;; This module contains facilities for showing information provided by the
;; Idris compiler in a separate buffer, as well as keeping the irritation of
;; that buffer to a minimum.

;;; Code:
(require 'idris-core)
(require 'idris-common-utils)

(defvar idris-info-buffer-name (idris-buffer-name :info)
  "The name of the buffer containing Idris help information")

(defvar idris-info-mode-map
  (let ((map (make-keymap)))
    (suppress-keymap map) ; remove the self-inserting char commands
    (define-key map (kbd "q") 'idris-info-quit)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-t") 'idris-type-at-point)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-d") 'idris-docs-at-point)
    map))

  "Major mode used for transient Idris information buffers
